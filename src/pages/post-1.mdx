This is a sample post, and this is an introduction. You can just write `# Table of contents` in your Markdown to automagically generate one!

# Table of contents

# Sidenotes

You can also add sidenotes<Sidenote>
Look into the [.mdx file](https://github.com/ApoorvaJ/technical-blog-template/blob/main/src/pages/post-1.mdx?plain=1#L17) to see how this is done!
</Sidenote> right in the Markdown. Sidenotes will render on the side large screens, but will automatically get reformatted on small devices. Nice, responsive CSS. Here's another reference.<Sidenote>
The sidenote numbers will increment automatically.</Sidenote>

 You can create un-numbered references too.<Sidenote numbered={false}>Just use the syntax `<Sidenote numbered={false}>` in the Markdown.</Sidenote>

# Blog post list

If you go the [home page](/)this blog post and others like it are automatically enumerated and sorted by date.

# RSS feed

The RSS feed is automatically generated too. Look in the footer for the link.

# Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting happens at build time, so your users don't have to download client-side libraries for this.

```cpp
int main() {
    printf("Hello world\n");
}
```

# Math support

$\LaTeX$ syntax is supported. Just type the notation between `$` signs in markdown.

It works with inlined math as seen above, but also with standalone math:

$ \begin{aligned}
A &= B \cr
\frac{C + D}{\pi} &= E \cr
\end{aligned} $

# Custom HTML

You can add custom HTML elements in the Markdown. For example:

<input type="range" min="0" max="1" value="0.5" step="0.01" class="slider accent-blue-500 w-3/6" id="slider" oninput=""/>

# Custom Javascript

You can add custom javascript in the Markdown as follows:

`<script is:inline src="/foo.js"></script>`, where `foo.js` would be located in the `public` folder of your repo.
